## How to Use ZSHbuntu

### Create a Docker Volume:
- Create a Docker volume named "zshbuntu-sandbox" by running the following command:
```shell
docker volume create zshbuntu-sandbox
```
- This volume will be used to store and reuse your configuration and setups.

### Run the ZSHbuntu Docker Sandbox:
- To run the Docker image with the previously created volume mounted to `/home/sandbox` for the user **"sandbox"**, use the following command:
```shell
docker run --name sandbox -v zshbuntu-sandbox:/home/sandbox --rm -it macabrequinox/zshbuntu:23.04
```
- This command starts the ZSHbuntu Docker container, providing you with a secure and permission-free environment to run commands and experiment.

Now you're ready to enjoy your ZSHbuntu Docker Sandbox, where you can safely execute commands without worrying about permissions or security issues. Feel free to customize your environment and configurations within the sandbox, and any changes will be stored in the "zshbuntu-sandbox" volume for future use.
